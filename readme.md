# ASSIGNMENT 1 AOS


## FILE EXPLORER IN LINUX
## Info about assignment 
THE Files PRESENT  INSIDE THE folder  ARE:
1. main.cpp
2. readme.md


## Some points (NORMAL MODE):
1. In the normal mode, the 'h'(home key) will  take to  the directory from where the application was started. 
2. The file name has been printed upto 10 characters only.
3. THe up and down arrow keys will let us move up and down.
4. The k and l keys will handle overflow and enable scrollling.



## Some points (Regarding handling the resizing of the terminal ):
1. The application will work perfectly when the width of the terminal is enough to accommodate the entries in one line.
2. The SIGNAL() function has been used to handle the resizing of the terminal.
3. The rendering of text and the functionality of the application is absolutely fine when the teminal is resized (only height wise).
4. So the application should be opened in the terminal dimensions as follows:
   1. height( any size)
   2. width( atleast as much required to aaccommodate 1 row entry .)
